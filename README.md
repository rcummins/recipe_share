## Application description
Recipe Share is an app where you can post cooking recipes and discover new recipes based on their average rating. Recipe Share allows users to:
* Create an account and log in/out
* Create and edit your own recipes
* Rate other recipes on their taste and effort involved
* Sort recipes by rating
* Add recipes to your list of favorites

## Future
Suggestions to improve Recipe Share are always welcome! Here are some features I would like to add to Recipe Share in the future:
* Changing the serving size for a recipe dynamically recalculates the quantities of all ingredients
* Recipe authors can upload photos to be shown along with ingredients and instructions
* Recipes can be tagged based on main ingredients, entree/side/dessert, holiday, etc., and users can filter recipes by tags
